            <p>
              Countries where your information is processed may not have data
              protection laws as comprehensive as those in your home country.
              However, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard your

              We have implemented Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), recognized by
              EEA and UK data protection authorities, to ensure an adequate

                If deletion or anonymization is not possible (e.g., due to

                further processing until deletion is feasible.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

              </li>

            <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>
              Most web browsers, mobile operating systems, and applications
              offer a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature that allows you to signal your
              preference not to have your online activities monitored.
              <br />
              However, as no uniform standard for recognizing and implementing
              DNT signals has been finalized, we do not currently respond to DNT
              signals or similar mechanisms.
              <br />
              If a standard for online tracking is established that we are
              required to follow, we will update this privacy notice to reflect
              such practices.
