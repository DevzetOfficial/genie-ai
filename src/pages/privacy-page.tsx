              The Services are not intended for distribution or use in any

            <h2>20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
            <h4>Informal Negotiations</h4>
            <p>
              Before initiating arbitration, the Parties agree to attempt to
              resolve any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal
              Terms ("Dispute") informally. Informal negotiations must last at
              least thirty (30) days and will commence upon written notice from
              one Party to the other.
            </p>
            <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
            <p>
              If a Dispute cannot be resolved through informal negotiations, it
              will be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration under the
              Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
              Association (AAA) and, if applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary
              Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. These rules are
              available on the AAA website.

                Arbitration Process:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Arbitration may occur in person, through document
                    submission, by phone, or online.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The arbitrator must follow applicable laws and provide a
                    written decision upon request.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The arbitration will take place in California unless
                    otherwise required by the AAA rules or applicable law.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                Court Involvement:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Courts may be used to compel arbitration, stay proceedings
                    pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate, or enforce
                    the arbitration award.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                No Court Action:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT
                    TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
                  </li>
                </ul>

            </ol>

            <h4>Court Jurisdiction</h4>
            <p>
              If arbitration is deemed illegal or unenforceable, Disputes will
              be resolved in the state or federal courts located in California.
              Both Parties consent to personal jurisdiction in these courts and
              waive defenses of lack of jurisdiction or inconvenient forum.
            </p>
            <h4>Time Limitation</h4>
            <p>
              No Dispute related to the Services may be brought more than one

            </p>
            <h4>Restrictions on Arbitration</h4>
            <p>
              Arbitration will be limited to the Parties individually. To the
              fullest extent permitted by law:

            <ul>
              <li>No arbitration may be joined with another proceeding.</li>
              <li>
                Disputes cannot be arbitrated on a class-action basis or as a

              </li>
              <li>
                Claims cannot be brought on behalf of the general public or
                others.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
            <p>
              The following Disputes are not subject to informal negotiations or
              arbitration:
            </p>

              <li>Disputes related to intellectual property rights.</li>
              <li>
                Claims involving theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
